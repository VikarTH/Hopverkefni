Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer FPS which pits a team of 6 to fight against each other. The objective of the game varies after gamemode. On a gamemode called 
"Payload", attackers have to escort a payload to the designated destination, touching checkpoints on the way while the defending team tries to stop that from happening.
"Capture Points" is a gamemode where the attacking team has to capture a specific spot on the map while the defending team tries to stop that from happening as well.
"Hybrid" gamemode is a mix of both of the above. The attacking team has to capture a specific point to unlock the payload, which they will then push to the end destination.
The defending team will try to stop the attacking team from either capturing the point or pushing the payload to the objective.
"Control" is a KotH style gamemode where both teams try to control a specific part of the map for a designated time. The first team to finish their time by having the
point captured wins the round. You can practice against bots, match randomly against other players, or play its ranked mode where you'll play competitively versus others.

Overwatch was announced on November 7th, 2014. Released on May 23rd, 2016. Development of Overwatch was started when the cancellation of the game Titan came to be.
